                                        <b>Battlerite (Arena)</b> is an <i>Fantasy Top-down Team Arena Brawler</i> with focus on fast-paced action without any random elements. Two teams of 2 or 3 players fight against each other using their specialized champions with varied abilities.

                                        I joined the studio with my specialization being in programming. The majority of my time was spent <b>prototyping and developing new game modes</b>,
                                        but I also had the pleasure to work on multiple things like <b>Encounter design</b> to update the tutorial and campaign mode, as well some minor <b>Level-</b>, and <b>Character design</b>.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        Additionally I got to work on <b>UI wireframing and mockups</b> for the then upcoming UI overhaul (which you can read more about on Stunlock's at the time UI/UX designer Katey Parr's <a href="http://kateyparr.com/project/battlerite-menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title='Katey Parr website article link'>breakdown</a>).

                                <p>
                                    The first significant project I worked on at Stunlock Studios was <b>Bakkoâ€™s Egg Brawl</b>, or just simply <i>Dodgeball</i> as we called it internally.
                                </p>
                                <p>The base prototype came from one of the game designer interns that were prototyping a way to quick-reflect incoming projectiles instead of using using the already established reflect mechanic which last much longer, and he had changed one ability to throw insta-kill spherical projectiles, so we called it <i>dodgeball</i>.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><b>My personal work on this project consisted of:</b></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Designing and implementing drop/pick-up mechanics for the eggs, and also to visually change your Champion's current weapon slot into a picked up egg.</li>
                                    <li>Creating basic system for spawning randomized eggs of different mechanics at specific locations.</li>
                                    <li>Game balancing & spell effects modifications.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br />
                                <div className="content-image -second"></div>
                                <p>
                                    Our mentor, a senior Technical Artist at the studio, took notice of what we were doing and pitched the dodgeball mode to the rest of the studio which got greenlit for the upcoming easter event, and suggested that we would combine the different systems that we were working on.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    At that moment the Champion we used for our dodgeball mode was <i>Lucie</i>, a petite alchemist girl, which we used because she had both a dodge and throwing mechanic, and animations for both, but was changed into <i>Bakko</i>, a burly shield-wielding warrior, instead because he had the more appropriate reflect mechanic and a throwing animation as well.
                                </p>
