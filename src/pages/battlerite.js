                                        I joined the studio with my specialization being in programming. The majority of my time was spent <b>prototyping and developing new game modes</b>,
                                        but I also had the pleasure to work on multiple things like <b>Encounter design</b> for the updated tutorial and campaign mode, as well some minor <b>Level-</b>, and <b>Character design</b>.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        Additionally I got to work on <b>UI wireframing and mockups</b> for the then upcoming UI overhaul (which you can read more about on Stunlock's at the time UI/UX designer Katey Parr's <a target="_blank" href="http://kateyparr.com/project/battlerite-menu">breakdown</a>).

                                <h2>Bakko's Egg Brawl</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The first significant project I worked on at Stunlock Studios was <b>Bakkoâ€™s Egg Brawl</b>, or just simply <i>Dodgeball</i> as we called it internally. The base prototype came from one of the game designer interns that were prototyping a way to quick-reflect incoming projectiles instead of using using the already established reflect mechanic which last much longer, and he had changed one ability to throw insta-kill spherical projectiles, so we called it <i>dodgeball</i>.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    At the same time I was working on a pick-up system (I was trying to implement some kind of RPG weapon equipment system), while our other programmer intern was working on modifying the ricochet mechanic to be able to have projectiles bouncing all over the place until it hit a viable target.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    Our mentor, a senior Technical Artist at the studio, took notice of what we were doing and pitched the dodgeball mode to the rest of the studio which got greenlit for the upcoming easter event, and suggested that we would combine the different systems that we were working on.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <div className="content-image -second"></div>
                                <p>
                                    At that moment the Champion we used for our dodgeball mode was <i>Lucie</i>, a petite alchemist girl, which we used because she had both a dodge and throwing mechanic, and animations for both, but was changed into <i>Bakko</i>, a burly shield-wielding warrior, instead because he had the more appropriate reflect mechanic and a throwing animation as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The pick-up system I worked on and implemented were expanded to handle different kinds of projectile blueprints so we could have a range of various projectiles with unique mechanics. I also worked on the pick-up spawning on defined locations around the map.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    The last thing I worked on for this particular game mode were modifying values for balance, and spell effects to better suit the Easter-event theme.
                                </p>
