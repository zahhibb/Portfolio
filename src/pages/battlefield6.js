                  <p>
                    This is a <strong>personal project</strong> where I wanted
                    to try my hand at replicating the style of recent{' '}
                    <i>Battlefield</i> games while also at the same time
                    attempting to make something structurally new. My goal was
                    to create a concept of how the upcoming <i>Battlefield</i>{' '}
                    game could look.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Prior to this, I had no education or skill in{' '}
                    <strong>UI design</strong> and this was heavily based on my
                    own <strong>bias and preference.</strong>

                  <h2>What I did</h2>
                  <p>
                    As I had no relevant understanding of how UI was designed at
                    the time I began with making various{' '}
                    <i>low-fidelity wireframes</i> of <b>Main menus</b> to find
                    what would structurally look good and that could be extended
                    upon later on.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    In the end, I made 2 <b>main menu</b>{' '}
                    <i>high-fidelity wireframes</i> that I felt captured the
                    aesthetics of how recent <i>Battlefield</i> games' menus
                    looked.

                Taking into consideration the recent <i>Battlefield</i> games'
                UI and layout while simultaneously anticipating that the
                upcoming game in the series would be set in a modern
                time-period, I referenced and broke down those previous games'
                main menus to find something somewhat different layout-wise. My
                approach being to <strong>define key elements</strong> and{' '}
                <strong>adhere to a systematic structure.</strong>

                    <strong>Primary references</strong> and{' '}
                    <strong>inspiration</strong> came from the two most recent
                    games (at the time); <i>Battlefield 1</i> and{' '}
                    <i>Battlefield 5</i>, the reason being that UX principles
                    and UI layouts/aesthetics follows seemingly migratory
                    patterns that changes the design standards over time. My
                    premise were to consider those changes and hopefully improve

                  <h3>Low-fidelity wireframes</h3>
                  <p>
                    When designing the initial sketches/wireframes I wanted to
                    translate some particular UI elements of the previous games
                    into my design &#8212; specifically the{' '}
                    <strong>minimalist</strong> and sharp container elements to
                    sustain the <i>familiar design</i> between the games.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>The first wireframe</strong> was basically a
                      carbon copy of <i>Battlefield 5's</i> main menu. I was
                      primarily getting familiarized with the{' '}
                      <strong>Adobe XD</strong> at this point as I hadn't used
                      it before.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The <strong>second wireframe</strong> was decent but I
                      felt I steered off too much from the identity of the{' '}
                      <i>Battlefield</i> design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>The third pass</strong> is where I felt I was
                      getting close, however, the navigation didn't feel modern
                      enough and the general layout didn't have an intention.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Fourth and last iteration</strong>. Here I removed
                      the container element of the navigation bar to make the
                      selected option stand out more and modified the layout to
                      present a sort of hierarchical design. The largest element
                      being the Hero/CTA and the other stacked elements being
                      staggered to virtually present an arrow pointing towards
                      the CTA.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

              <div className="work-pairs">

                  <p>
                    Going into the design of the high-fidelity was the thing I
                    was looking forward to the most since this would be where
                    the actual <strong>identity</strong> of the project would be
                    incorporated. The majority of the rendered assets and images
                    used came from previous <i>Battlefield</i> games'
                    promotional material, and some content was from different
                    artists on <i>ArtStation</i> or <i>Pinterest</i>.

                  At the end of the project, I felt that I wanted something
                  additional but different to break up the focus on menus, so I
                  tried my hand at <strong>photobashing</strong> various images
                  into one mockup, to present how UI would look in a{' '}
                  <strong>gameplay</strong> situation instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I ended up <u>not</u> finishing this, but the general idea and
                  approach were fun and something I probably want to improve on
                  in the future.

                    <strong>Image of a blue, better looking, sky</strong> to

                    is the first-person view of a character holding a gun,
                    borrowed from <i>Escape From Tarkov</i>. Not only does this
                    bring the illusion to life, but it presents from a
                    designer's point of view how important it is to think about
                    the horizontal positioning of the asset and how much it
                    occludes from the player.

                    The very last thing I did was some{' '}
                    <strong>color grading</strong> by bumping up the{' '}
                    <strong>saturation</strong> to make it a bit{' '}
                    <i>less like real life</i>, partly blending them with the
                    digital ones. Unfortunately, no UI or HUD graphics were made
                    for this gameplay mockup as I felt I hadn't planned it out
                    enough and I had spent more time than I wanted on this
                    project already.
