                  <p>
                    While I initially was going to focus on UX and Game design
                    as is the direction of my studies and my interest, I had to
                    step up and be the programmer of this project because of
                    some unforeseen circumstances that both of the programmers
                    assigned to our team left the education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I, fortunately, had some experience in <b>C# programming</b>{' '}
                    and <b>Unity</b> so we could still create a game, though we
                    had to re-scope the project a lot.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    On this project, I worked on <b>programming</b>,{' '}
                    <b>level-</b> & <b>system design</b>.

                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>
                  The project began with brainstorming, pitching our ideas to
                  each other, and setting up an early schedule on how long we
                  could spend on specific tasks. We decided right away to spend
                  the entire first week on planning and conception to be
                  thorough and define what features we wanted in the final game.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The concept we decided on was a combination of one of mine and
                  the other UX designer's ideas, which was a horror-Esque puzzle
                  game where you could switch between 2 characters; a living
                  human and a spirit/devil, trying to escape a house of traps.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The idea got defined a bit more and evolved into a
                  dungeon-escape game where the player has to use both of the
                  characters to interact with things in the environment and
                  possess objects out of reach.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                  Our process came down to <b>sketching</b> and{' '}
                  <b>paper prototyping</b> at first, and when we felt we had
                  established our initial design we began with <b>greyboxing</b>{' '}
                  some basic levels/puzzles.

                  Together with the, at the time, sole programmer of our group
                  we set up the technical parts of the project -{' '}
                  <i>Unity project files</i>, <i>Version Control</i>, and{' '}
                  <i>code & file standards</i>. We worked steadily but
                  unfortunately our last and only programmer also left the education
                  and I was the one with the most previous relevant technical
                  knowledge regarding Unity and C# programming.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Now we had to be flexible, so we restructured the project and
                  I went to work on the main mechanics right away, and worked on
                  programming-related tasks for the rest of the project, while
                  the other designer and the project managers work on everythng
                  non-technical such as level-dressing, UI design, and
                  music/sounds.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>All in all I coded about 90% of the game and implemented all major systems used, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wes-ekman-74648a220/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wes</a>, our second designer, helped out generally with everything else and implemented & coded the last epilogue/credits scene.</p>

                  <p>
                    These are some of the features that we had initially planned
                    to implement but had to be scrapped due to time constraints
                    and/or lack of knowledge.

                        A swirling tether/link between Adam and the Spirit that
                        would emphasize their connection to each other. The link
                        was intended to be one of the main threats of the game,
                        which would break if the characters got too far away
                        from each other, resulting in death.

                      <p>
                        We felt this mechanic could be expanded on later as a
                        type of progression system to present more intricate
                        puzzles.

                        Initially, we intended to have all objects in the
                        environment have specific abilities when possessed, for
                        example, turning on generators to power magnets/conveyor
                        belts or turning on/off lights to solve light-related
                        puzzles.

                        <u>Larger encompassing levels</u>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Our design at the start was to have a camera following
                        the player character throughout several smaller rooms in
                        a bigger level, where each "completed" room would serve
                        as a point to progress to the next level. The Player
                        would be free to roam between most of the rooms in any
                        way they want, to choose which puzzle to tackle first.
                        A lot of inspiration for this, both mechanically and
                        aesthetically, came from the game series{' '}
                        <i>Luigi's Mansion</i>.
