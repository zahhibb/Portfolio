                    During my time studying at <b>FutureGames</b>, we got an
                    assignment to design a <b>UI/HUD</b> for an existing game or
                    make up an original concept. Our assignment was to go
                    through every stage of the design process from start to
                    finish, like <b>sketching</b>, <b>low-</b> &{' '}
                    <b>high-fidelity wireframing</b>, and implement it to be
                    functional inside of <b>Unity</b> or <b>Figma</b>.

                    as a concept, which is intended to be a{' '}
                    <i>futuristic post-apocalyptic first-person shooter</i>.

                  <h2>What I did</h2>
                  <p>
                    During these 4 weeks, I decided to try imagining what this
                    new upcoming game's UI would look like, and as there was no
                    information surrounding the game except for some concepts,
                    the theme, and genre, I had to come up with design decisions
                    myself on what the game would have.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    The premise I decided to go for was a{' '}
                    <strong>4-player Co-op Survival</strong> game, so the UI and
                    the menus would have to manage that data. What I ended up
                    working on was the primary menus, from assembling a team, to
                    deciding gear and starting location.

                  <h3>Sketch pass 1</h3>
                  <p>
                    I began by sketching various designs to find something that
                    I feel could be considered modern and somewhat sci-fi.

                  <h3>Sketch pass 2</h3>
                  <p>
                    After asking and receiving some feedback on what people felt
                    looked the best, I decided on a design similar to{' '}
                    <i>Battlefield 2142</i> because of its straightforward
                    approach. I went on to design concepts for other menu
                    screens as well.

                <h3>Low-fidelity wireframes</h3>
                <p>
                  Continuing from the sketches I jumped straight into converting
                  them to <strong>low-fidelity wireframes</strong>, now taking
                  the layout, padding, margins, and white spaces into a lot more
                  consideration. Stylistic changes were still made at this
                  stage, though the general blocking of elements would remain.
                </p>
                <div className="image-grid">
                  <img
                    src={PioneerLowFidImage}
                    alt="Low-fidelity wireframes of the previous sketches"
                  />
                </div>
              </div>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3>High-fidelity wireframes</h3>
              <p>
                Now getting closer to the very end, the focus would be on{' '}
                <strong>aesthetics</strong>, <strong>ornaments</strong>,{' '}
                <strong>colors</strong>, and filling the UI with more relevant
                art to give it all a bit more <i>'Oomph!'</i>. However, I
                realized that some of my designs such as the staging screen
                (Venture) and Loadout screen felt too{' '}
                <strong>simplistic</strong> and didn't have a modern feel to
                them.{' '}
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                As a last resort, a <strong>re-design</strong> of these layouts
                was made, now presenting the chosen setup of your character on
                an initial page while also not filling up and cluttering the
                entire screen &#8212;{' '}
                <strong>allowing the design to breathe</strong> a bit more!
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                One additional thing that changed was the intended platform
                design, as initially the design was made to be for{' '}
                <strong>gaming consoles (XBOX/Playstation)</strong> with{' '}
                <strong>large elements to be easily distinguishable</strong>{' '}
                from a distance. This changed a bit due to my realization that
                implementing this design later into <i>Unity</i> would be a
                larger task than I previously anticipated as I didn't have time
                until the deadline to learn gamepad implementation. The result
                ended up being to change the visual input prompts from gamepad
                buttons into keyboard keys and mouse buttons.
